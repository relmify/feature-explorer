/**
 * Incoming events
 *
 * The application service subscribes to these events
 * This section should show the data structures for all of these
 * events. Again, the data structures only use simple types.
 *
 * I think these should actually be defined in each domain service
 * interface and imported here. Not defined here.
 *
 * This file will contain code that interacts with the domain services
 * via events.
 *
 * In this case it mostly subscribes and reacts to events
 * The only commands are related to configuring which files to
 * report on, and when to start or stop summarizing.
